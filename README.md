# Live Football Score Board

Small project to show a Live Football Score Board

## How to use

Execute the `npm start` script and go to `http://localhost:3000` once loaded.

A list of matches is shown on the screen. Click the `Start Match` button of the match you want to be started. The score of that match will be initiated as `0 - 0`.

To update the score, simply click the `Home Team Goal` or `Away Team Goal` button depending on the team you want to update its score in increments of 1.

If you want to finish a match, simply click the `Finish Match` button.

You can also get an updated summary of the matches by score and update time. Click the `Get Summary` button, and a list should appear below that same button.

## Notes

The app is not 100% responsive. Might not be visually perfect in all devices.
